PROJECT SUSPENDED

This project was meant to play a platformer game on an online shop's website for me. The reason why I undertook this task was because of existing leaderboards, and I presumed that I could get to the leaderboard and use some funny custom nickname. It was my first big Python project, in fact.

During the process it turned out that I cannot get onto the leaderboard anymore, so there was no reason for doing that since I couldn't make the joke anymore. Also, I didn't feel like this was funy for anyone besides me, so I can't use this as anegdote on parties. It also started to became more and more mundane. As a result, I had gladly dropped this project some time ago, and since I've today started racial recognition in movie industry project, I have decided to archivize this project. Maybe I will come back to it at some point, or maybe someone will get on this project because they will feel some undiscovered potential?

It was still fun experience btw, I've learned quite a lot, especially in the beginning of the process.


Anyway, best wishes for those who came across this project, enjoy your coding
